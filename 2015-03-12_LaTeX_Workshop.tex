%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection*{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{What is \LaTeX?}
\LaTeX~is a markup language written for the \TeX~typesetting program.
\begin{columns}[c]
\column{2.50in}
  \begin{block}{Features of \LaTeX}
    \begin{itemize}
    			\item Open source
    			\item Allows public to produce high-quality documents individually
			\item Provides identical output on all computers (both now and in the future)
			\item Widely used in academia
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Ex. Mathematics, computer science, economics, engineering, physics, and statistics.
				\end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\subsection*{Why \LaTeX{}?}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Why would I want to use \LaTeX{}?}
\textbf{Q.} Why would I want to learn how to use \LaTeX{} when I can just use Word?
	\begin{block}{Answer(s)}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Open source
			\item Output is in PDF (through \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PdfTeX}{pdf\TeX})
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Can view on any computer and never have to worry about presentation not showing up right.
				\end{itemize}
			%
			\item Ability to typeset mathematical equations quickly and cleanly
			\item Professional standard in academia
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Aren't these really just cosmetic reasons?}
Yes, but to some degree you will be judged by the quality of the way your present your work. Also, ease of dissemination of information is very important in research.
	\begin{block}{Bottom line}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Setup and Installation}
	\begin{block}{To get a \LaTeX~distribution on your computer}
		\begin{itemize}
    			\item Download and install the \href{http://www.latex-project.org/ftp.html}{distribution} for your operating system.
				\begin{itemize} \item Probably the latest version of \href{http://www.tug.org/texlive/}{\TeX~Live}.\end{itemize}
			\item Download and install a front end (or be hardcore and just use vim/emacs. :P)
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Windows: \href{http://miktex.org/}{MiKTeX}
					\item Mac: \href{http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/}{TeXShop}
					\item Linux: \href{http://www.tug.org/texworks/}{TeXworks}
				\end{itemize}
			%
			\item Install any packages you want in the proper directory
			\item Start creating!

		\item We're going to start from scratch, so select all and delete

\section{Math Mode}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Typesetting in Math Mode}
Typesetting in Math Mode is what really gives \LaTeX~its power. It is intuitive, quick, clean, and produces wonderful results! To initiate Math Mode enclose whatever you want to typeset between two ``\$''.
	\begin{block}{Some examples}
		\begin{itemize}
    			\item \$\textbackslash Sigma\$ = $\Sigma$
			\item \$\textbackslash int f(x) \textbackslash,dx\$ = $\int f(x)\,dx$
			\item \$e\textasciicircum x\_\{\textbackslash text\{text\}\}\$ = $e^x_{\text{text}}$
			\item \$\textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash sin x\}\{\textbackslash prod\_\{i=0\}\textasciicircum n\}\$ = $\frac{\sin x}{\prod_{i=0}^n}$
    		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
and so\ldots
\[
\imply \int\limits_{\rho}^R \frac{\sqrt[3]{r}\,\ln r}{r^2 + 1}~dr + \int_{L_2} f(z)~dz = e^{i \pi/3} \int\limits_{\rho}^R \frac{\sqrt[3]{r}\,\ln r + i \pi \sqrt[3]{r}}{r^2 + 1}~dr% = \frac{i\pi^2}{2}\,e^{i \pi/6} - \int_{C_\rho} f(z)~dz - \int_{C_R} f(z)~dz
\]
\end{frame}

%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Math Mode: Display Style}
The displaymath environment will pop your equation out of the text and display it prominently in the center of the page.
	\begin{block}{In Line vs. Displayed}
		\begin{itemize}
    			\item It is seen that this requires $C = -k^2$, where $k^2>0$, reducing to $\rho\partiald{}{\rho} \parenthsqr{\rho \partiald{R\parenth{\rho}}{\rho}} - \parenth{n^2 - \rho^2 k^2} R\parenth{\rho} = 0.$
			\item It is seen that this requires $C = -k^2$, where $k^2>0$, reducing to \[\rho\partiald{}{\rho} \parenthsqr{\rho \partiald{R\parenth{\rho}}{\rho}} - \parenth{n^2 - \rho^2 k^2} R\parenth{\rho} = 0.\]
    		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
\end{frame}

%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Math Mode: Display Style}
The displaymath environment is entered by enclosing whatever you want to typeset between opening ``\textbackslash['' and closing ``\textbackslash]''.
	\begin{block}{In Line vs. Displayed}
		\begin{itemize}
    			\item \$\textbackslash int \textbackslash limits\_\{-\textbackslash infty\}\textasciicircum \{\textbackslash infty\} \textbackslash psi\textasciicircum* \textbackslash psi \textbackslash,dx \$ = $\infint \psi^* \psi\,dx$
			\item \textbackslash[ \textbackslash int \textbackslash limits\_\{-\textbackslash infty\}\textasciicircum \{\textbackslash infty\} \textbackslash psi\textasciicircum* \textbackslash psi \textbackslash,dx \textbackslash] = \[\infint \psi^* \psi\,dx \]

\section{Packages \& Fun!}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Fun with Packages!}
There are a ton of really useful packages, and just fun packages that you can use to make your documents stand out and entertaining.
	\begin{block}{One useful and N fun packages}
		\begin{itemize}
    			\item My ``\href{http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6351966/custom.sty}{custom}'' style file (what I use for \TeX ing~my homework).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{How Can I Learn More About \LaTeX{}?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \href{https://www.ctan.org/}{Comprehensive \TeX{} Archive Network (CTAN)}
		\item There are lots of great online resources. A great place to start is \href{https://www.overleaf.com/}{Overleaf}.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Free student accounts
				\item Free \href{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/learn/free-online-introduction-to-latex-part-1\#.VPkJ7c3d-oo}{\LaTeX{} tutorial} very similar to one given tonight
			\end{itemize}
		\item Questions or confused? Check the \href{http://tex.stackexchange.com/}{\TeX{} Stack Exchange}
		\item Ask people who have used \LaTeX{}. They're usually happy to share their tricks of the trade.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection*{Packages}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Installing packages}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Most distributions will come with a package manager. It let's you search and install packages by query.
		\item If you don't know where to install a package so it can be universally accessed by your operating system, just save it in the same directory as your \TeX~file.
		\item If you're working on a Windows machine you'll probably need to run ``\href{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/48292/about-texhash-and-proper-installation-of-texlive}{texhash}'' from the command prompt before your computer will recognize the new package.

\begin{frame}{How is \LaTeX{} pronounced?}
The original author, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport}{Leslie Lamport}, says in his book \href{http://www.amazon.com/LaTeX-Document-Preparation-System-Edition/dp/0201529831}{\emph{LaTeX: A document Preparation System}}
	\begin{block}{}
One of the hardest things about \LaTeX{} is deciding how to pronounce it. This is also one of the few things I'm not going to tell you about \LaTeX, since pronunciation is best determined by usage, not fiat. \TeX{} is usually pronounced ``\emph{teck}'', making ``\emph{lah}-teck'', and ``\emph{lay}-teck'' the logical choices; but language is not always logical, so ``lay-tecks'' is also possible.
